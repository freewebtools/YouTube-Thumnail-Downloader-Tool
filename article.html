        Aditya - L1 First Indian Mission To Study The Sun
    </div>
    <div class="text">
        Dear readers, as we know our ISRO planned for first Indian spacecraft mission to study the sun named ADITYA L1.In Sanskrit, Aditya is the name of the sun.It has been designed and will be built in collaboration between ISRO, IIA (Indian Institute of Astrophysics), Udaipur Solar Observatory, ARIES (Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences), TIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research), and some Indian universities.It is planned to launch in end of 2020, but due to COVID 19 and other ambitious projects such as Gaganyaan it is unclear when ISRO will launch Aditya.
The Aditya-1 mission was conceived as a 400kg class satellite carrying one payload, the Visible Emission Line Coronagraph (VELC) and was planned to launch in a 800 km low earth orbit.A Satellite placed in the halo orbit around the Lagrangian point 1 (L1) of the Sun-Earth system has the major advantage of continuously viewing the Sun without any occultation/ eclipses. Therefore, the Aditya-1 mission has now been revised to “Aditya-L1 mission” and will be inserted in a halo orbit around the L1, which is 1.5 million km from the Earth.Now a question may pops up on some of  your mind that what is  Lagrangian point and Halo Orbit.so lets discuss about Lagrangian point and Halo Orbit...
A Lagrangian point is a region of space that lies partway between the Earth and the Sun where gravitational forces of both bodies are balanced.ESA explains that a spacecraft in orbit around these points will simply hover without the influence of any gravitational force. This makes it possible to place objects in a 3D orbit around these points which is known as a halo orbit.The first point of these points is L1 that lies 1.5 million km away from the Earth towards the Sun. It is the future destination of Aditya L1 and the current abode to the Solar and Heliospheric Observatory(SOHO), an ESA/NASA collaboration. The main advantage of placing the Aditya spacecraft in a halo orbit around L1 is continuous observations of the Sun without any obstructions or eclipses.
The easiest way to understand Lagrange points is to think of them in much the same way that wind speeds can be inferred from a weather map. The forces are strongest when the contours of the effective potential are closest together and weakest when the contours are far apart.Now many of you may have a question “Why ISRO planned for such a mission?,What’s the significance of this specific mission?” the objectives are written below...
The major scientific objectives of Aditya-1 are to achieve a fundamental understanding of the physical processes that heat the solar corona (from the base to the extended region), accelerate the solar wind, and produce CMEs (Coronal Mass Ejections). To achieve these objectives, the Aditya coronagraph requires the capabilities for the following observations:
    • High frequency intensity oscillations (~ 1 Hz)
    • Dynamics of coronal loops with high cadence
    • Magnetic field topology
    • CMEs close to the solar disk.
The Aditya-1 observations will include coronal waves, cooling of coronal loops, temperature structure of coronal loops, formation and development of coronal loops, monitoring topology of coronal magnetic field, loop dynamics, dynamical scale heights of coronal loops, flows in the coronal loops and CME studies.
The goals are to detect the existence of waves in the solar corona and the nature of waves, to investigate the role of waves in heating the solar coronal plasma, to understand the formation of coronal loops, to understand the magnetic nature of coronal loops, to understand the cooling of post flare loops and to investigate the pre-eruption dynamics of CMEs in detail.Now let’s talk about the ADITYA spacecraft
The Aditya spacecraft is 3-axis stabilized using the IMS (Indian MiniSatellite) bus of SARAL (Satellite with Argos and AltiKa) mission heritage (launch in 2011). The spacecraft is developed as a standard satellite bus by ISAC (ISRO Satellite Center), which can be used for missions for remote sensing, communications and space science applications.
The structure of Aditya-L1 consists of aluminum skin honeycomb sandwich structure, a cuboid of size 89 cm x 89 cm x 61.5 cm. The payload will be accommodated on the top deck with localized corner brackets. The total mass of the spacecraft, including seven payloads, is expected to be around 1500 kg.
AOCS (Attitude and Orbit Control System): The AOCS configuration consists of various types of sensors for measurement of attitude errors, control electronics and different types of actuators such as reaction wheels, magnetic torquers and reaction control thrusters to impart thrust/torque to the spacecraft in the desired direction. The sensor system consists of a star sensor, sun sensors (4π FOV), magnetometer and precision sun sensor and the IRU (Inertial Referencing Unit). The IRU consists of three miniature gyroscopes, dynamically tuned and cluster mounted, and suspended with vibration isolators. Considering the stability requirement of < 5 x 10-5º/s, the option of using a FOG (Fiber Optic Gyro) solution is being studied. Three types of actuators are being used, reaction wheels, magnetic torquers and RCS (Reaction Control Subsystem) thrusters to control the orbit and the attitude of the spacecraft.
EPS (Electric Power Subsystem): The spacecraft features one solar wing with 2 panels, each of size 120 cm x 81 cm. The solar panels are stowed on the VD02 side in the launch configuration; they are programmed to auto deploy immediately after injection into the orbit. An average power of 400 W is available using multi-junction solar cells. A Li-ion battery provides power during the eclipse phase of the orbit. The EPS is configured as a single regulated, battery tied bus with one battery. The power electronics package performs the functions of solar array string switching, battery charge/discharge control and power conditioning and distribution. The power distribution scheme is based on the specific voltage and current requirements for all subsystems.
The BMU (Bus Management Unit) with the OBC takes care of all data handling functions using the MIL‐STD‐1553B standard interface with the star sensor and the payload. The payload data handling subsystem employs serial interfaces to the baseband data handling formatter. The formatter receives the payload data packets, annotates these with the housekeeping data, and deposits them onto the SSR. The BMU is built around state-of-the-art technologies using FPGAs and ASICs. It interfaces with TTC (RF), sensors, power, thrusters, MTCs (Magnetic Torque Controllers), gyros, wheel drive electronics and the payload.
The SPS (Satellite Positioning System) provides the state vector (position, velocity and time) of the spacecraft in real-time. A miniaturized GPS receiver is being used. The state vector of the satellite is sent to BMU through a serial interface. The system works in cold start mode, that is, it searches the sky, receives the GPS signals, and computes position, velocity and time without any prior information of the spacecraft' state vector.Now we have a Spacecraft successfully but a question may rises manyone’s mind ,”How to communicate with the spacecraft from earth?” So let’s discuss about the communication system...
We use radio frequency (RF) signal,a wireless electromagnetic signal as a form of communication, if one is discussing wireless electronics. Radio waves are a form of electromagnetic radiation with identified radio frequencies that range from 3kHz to 300 GHz. Frequency refers to the rate of oscillation (of the radio waves.) RF propagation occurs at the speed of light and does not need a medium like air in order to travel. The TT&C transponder consists of a S-band receiver, a transmitter and the antenna subsystem. The receiver is of a non-coherent type using the FM/PSK/PCM modulation scheme. The receiver provides frequency demodulation of the onboard received signal to extract the two switching PSK subcarrier signals. This output will be PSK demodulated to obtain data and clock. The FM/PSK demodulation is performed in the digital domain. The TT&C antenna offers a near omni-directional coverage to provide a reliable link during both the initial launch phase and on-orbit phase.
The DHS (Data Handling Subsystem) has two components: the BDH (Baseband Data Handling) subsystem and the RF transmitter. The payload data that is received by the BDH is formatted, randomized and fed to the transmitter. The transmitter accepts the digital data stream from the BDH, modulates the data in QPSX (Quadrature Phase Shift Keying) mode and transmits the data to a ground station using a conventional X-band (8.125 GHz) antenna. The DHS provides the following operational capabilities:
    • Input data rates: ~42 / 4.8 /2.4/ 56/0.224 Mbit/s
    • Data interface: Serial bit stream
    • Channel coding: RS (Reed Solomon) coding (255, 233), I = 5
    • Transmission data rate: 32 Mbit/s
    • Modulation: QPSK
    • SSR (Solid State Recorder) capacity: 32 Gbit on on-board storage. The SSR has the provision to support simultaneously data recording and playback. This feature is required to get uninterrupted observational data from the payload.
The X-band data transmission uses an 8 W SSPA (Solid State Power Amplifier). The data transmission is through a shaped beam antenna.Now it’s time to discuss about payloads,through which our desired datas will be recieved.There’ll be 7 payloads as VELC, SUIT, ASPEX, PAPA, SoLEXS, HELIOS,  FGM
       Visible emission line coronagraph (VELC) is the prime payload on board Aditya-L1.VELC is designed to be an internally occulted reflective coronagraph to meet the observational requirements of wide wavelength band and closer to the solar limb (1.05 Ro) as against the externally occulted and refractive coronagraphs. VELC has the capability of simultaneous spectroscopic observations of solar corona in emission lines 7892 Å (FeXI), 10747 Å (FeXII), and 5303 Å (FeXIV), spectropolarimetric obserDear readers, as we know our ISRO planned for first Indian spacecraft mission to study the sun named ADITYA L1.In Sanskrit, Aditya is the name of the sun.It has been designed and will be built in collaboration between ISRO, IIA (Indian Institute of Astrophysics), Udaipur Solar Observatory, ARIES (Aryabhatta Research Institute of Observational Sciences), TIFR (Tata Institute of Fundamental Research), and some Indian universities.It is planned to launch in end of 2020, but due to COVID 19 and other ambitious projects such as Gaganyaan it is unclear when ISRO will launch Aditya.

       Visible emission line coronagraph (VELC) is the prime payload on board Aditya-L1.VELC is designed to be an internally occulted reflective coronagraph to meet the observational requirements of wide wavelength band and closer to the solar limb (1.05 Ro) as against the externally occulted andvations in emission line 10747 Å (FeXII) and imaging of solar corona in continuum at 5000 Å (pass band 10 Å). Field of view (FOV) for spectroscopy and spectropolarimetry is 1.05 Ro to 1.5Ro (0.28 deg to 0.4 deg) and for continuum imaging is 1.05Ro to 3Ro (0.28 deg to 0.8 deg). The uniqueness of VELC stems from the fact that it is capable of simultaneous observations in multiple wavelength bands closer to the limb (1.05 Ro) with high pixel resolution and cadence as compared to the other space solar missions and ground-based solar coronagraphs.
 VELC Primary mirror (M1) is an off-axis parabolic mirror of clear aperture 192 mm with an off-axis distance of 152 mm is at a distance of 1570 mm from entrance aperture (EA). The diameter of EA is 147 mm to cover the desired FOV. Secondary mirror (M2), positioned at prime focus, acts as an internal occulter, which ejects the disc light (up to 1.05 Ro) through a central elliptical hole and reflects the coronal light over the FOV 1.05 Ro to 3Ro. M1, M2, and the collimator together reimages the entrance pupil. Lyotstop located after the collimator cuts off the diffracted light from EA. M4 directs the coronal light to different spectroscopic and imaging channels.
VELC will address the following science aspects:
    • Role of wave in coronal heating
    • How are CMEs accelerated ?
    • What is the nature of the interaction between the CME plasma and the magnetic field that drives the eruption ?
    • What is the configuration of the magnetic field in the corona?
    • How are the different components of the solar wind, slow and fast, accelerated ?
    • To what degree do coronal inhomogeneities affect the heating and acceleration process ?
      Observational requirements:
    • Imaging of the inner corona (1.05-3.0 solar radii) at high spatial and at high cadence (1-60 s)
    • Spectroscopic measurements (FOV: 1.05-1.5 solar radii) in two visible and one infrared line for understanding the heating, dynamics, temperature, density and structure of the solar corona.
    • Spectro-polarimetry in near infrared for topology and magnetic field measurements.
These aspects of VELC demands that the signal-to-noise ratio over the FOVof 1.05 Ro to 3Ro should be in the range of 10 to 0.1. This translates into total instrument background of 5 ppm (parts per million) with respect to disk intensity based on aperture size and photon number calculations.
The major contributors to the instrument back ground are (i) scattered disk light into the FOV due to the microroughness and particulate contamination over M1 surface and (ii) diffraction of solar disk light at EA. A detailed study will help in deciding the maximum allowed limit on the microroughness and surface cleanliness level of M1.
The SUIT (Solar Ultraviolet Imaging Telescope) instrument is being developed at IUCAA (Inter-University Center for Astronomy & Astrophysics),Pune, India. The objective is to image the spatially resolved Solar Photosphere and Chromosphere in near Ultraviolet (200-400 nm) and measure solar irradiance variations.
SUIT will tackle the following issues:
    • Coupling and dynamics of the solar atmosphere: What are the processes through which the energy is channelized and transferred from the photosphere to the chromosphere and then to the corona?
    • Initiation of CMEs:What are the kinematics of erupting prominences during the early phase?
    • Solar irradiance studies:Temporal variation and the spectral variation of the source regions.
    • Prominence studies: What are the mechanisms responsible for stability, dynamics and eruption of solar prominences?
      Observational requirements:
    • Full disk observations in NUV(200–400 nm) in about 10 passbands using a filter-wheel mechanism.
    • Combined medium and narrow-band filter imager with low stray light and high contrast to measure and monitor brightness contrast of solar magnetic features.
    • Total FOV ~ 1.1 solar radii to overlap the FOV of VELC.
    • Observations with different settings of cadence, exposure time, angular resolution, regions of interest, etc.
The data will be complemented with ground-based telescope data to provide magnetic field measurements. SUIT will provide continuous observations from photosphere, chromosphere and lower transition region.
The ASPEX (Aditya Solar wind Particle Experiment) instrument is being developed at PRL (Physical Research Laboratory), Ahmedabad, India. The objective is to study the variation of solar wind properties as well as its distribution and spectral characteristics.
ASPEX is aimed to:
    • Determine the variation of the spectrum of solar wind ions, supra-thermal ions and solar energetic particles during the solar cycle.
    • Determine the variation of the thermal anisotropy of the constituents of the solar wind (protons, α-particles, and heavy ions) which is a measure of the efficacy of various acceleration and heating processes thought to occur in the interplanetary medium.
    • Study of the supra-thermal tail of solar wind particles and temporal variation.
    • Investigate the energy dependence of proton/alpha ratio and the temperature anisotropy of solar wind particles.
      Instrument components:
    • SWIS(Solar Wind Ion Spectrometer) consisting of two independent units will have the capability of measuring solar wind particles in the energy range of 100 eV to 20 keV in the plane of the ecliptic and normal to the plane of the ecliptic, using an electrostatic analyzer (ESA) coupled to a micro channel plate (MCP) detector. While one of the SWIS units, referred to as Top Hat 1 (THA-1) will receive and differentiate particles (H+ and He++ ions) in the ecliptic plane (species differentiation mode), the second SWIS unit, referred to as Top Hat 2 (THA-2) will measure the total flux irrespective of types of species across the ecliptic plane (species integrated mode) 
    • STEPS(Supra Thermal Energetic Particle Spectrometer) will measure the particle flux in the 20 keV/n to 20 MeV/n energy range in the Sunward, anti-Sunward, Parker, ecliptic North and ecliptic South directions, using custom designed silicon detectors. Three STEPS units (Sunward, Parker and anti-Sunward) are designed to operate in the species differentiation mode while the remaining three STEPS units (between Sunward and Parker, ecliptic North and ecliptic South) will operate in the species-integrated mode.
ASPEX will complement coronagraphic observations by determining the arrival time of interplanetary CMEs at L1.
The PAPA (Plasma Analyzer Package for Aditya) instrument is being developed at SPL (Space Physics Laboratory),  VSSC (Vikram Sarabhai Space Center),Trivandrum, Kerela, India. The goal is to understand the composition of solar wind and its energy distribution. The scientific objectives are:
    • Continuous measurement of the solar wind and interplanetary electron distribution functions in the energy range 0.01-3 keV to extract the interplanetary magnetic field structure and topology.
    • Study the composition of the solar wind and thereby understanding about the origin of the solar wind and particle acceleration mechanism.
      Instrument components:
    • SWEEP(Solar Wind Electron Energy Probe) to measure the solar wind and interplanetary electron distribution functions in the energy range 0.01-3 keV.
    • SWICAR(Solar Wind Ion Composition Analyzer) to measure the kinetic temperatures and mean speeds of all major ion species in the mass range of 1-3 amu (atomic mass unit).
The SoLEXS (Solar Low Energy X-ray Spectrometer) instrument is being developed at ISAC (ISRO Satellite Center), Bangalore, India. The objective is to monitor the X-ray flares (1-30 keV) for studying the heating mechanism of the solar corona. The payload will provide:
    • Data for the study of the DC heating mechanism.
    • The physical characteristics of solar flares ranging from the X-class to the A-class along with its association of CMEs.
    • Independent measure of coronal temperature and DEM (Differential Emission Measure) as well as abundances of coronal plasma.
    • Study of the CME-flare relation and its physical mechanism.
      Observational requirement:
    • Single pixel SDD (Silicon Drift Detector) to observe the complete solar disk in the 1-30 keV range.
    • Large dynamic range and high spatial resolution (<250 eV @ 5.9 keV) to measure the large variation in flux.
    • FOV = 1º.
SoLEXS along with VELC, SUIT and the hard X-ray instrument will provide data to study the kinematics of solar flares and their energy content.
TheHEL1OS (High Energy L1 Orbiting X-ray Spectrometer)instrument is being developed at ISAC and at PRL (Physical Research Laboratory) of USO (Udaipur Solar Observatory). The objectives are to observe the dynamic events in the solar corona and provide an estimate of the energy used to accelerate the particles during the eruptive events (a spectrometer that views the Sun as a star and is designed to study hard X-ray (HXR) emission from 10 keV to 150 keV during the impulsive phase of solar flares).
The main science goals of HEL1OS are:
    • Study of explosive energy release, acceleration and transport of electrons using fast timing measurements and high resolution spectral studies.
    • Study of the evolution of low-energy non-thermal electron cut-off using high spectral resolution measurements.
    • Provide fast continuous timing data for the study of sub-second variability during flares.
    • Understanding the science of eruptive events using complimentary multi-wavelength observations.
      Observation requirement:
    • wo types of semiconductor detectors. CdZnTe and CdTe in the overall energy range of 10-150 keV will cover the overlap between thermal and non-thermal components of a solar flare.
    • Collimator FOV is 3º cone angle.
HEL1OS data will be complemented by VELC, SoLEXS, SUIT and ground observations in the radio bands.
Fluxgate Digital Magnetometer (FGM) is being  developed by LEOS (Laboratory for Electro Optics Systems) and ISAC, both institutions are located in Bangalore  to measure the local magnetic field which is necessary to supplement the outcome of other scientific experiments onboard. The insitu vector magnetic field data at L1 is essential for better understanding of the data provided by the particle and plasma analysis experiments, onboard Aditya-L1 mission. Also, the dynamics of Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) can be better understood with the help of insitu magnetic field data at the L1 point region. This data will also serve as crucial input for the short lead-time space weather forecasting models.
The proposed FGM is a dual range magnetic sensor on a 6 m long boom mounted on the Sun viewing panel deck and configured to deploy along the negative roll direction of the spacecraft. Two sets of sensors (tri-axial each) are proposed to be mounted, one at the tip of boom (6 m from the spacecraft) and other, midway (3 m from the spacecraft). The main science objective of this experiment is to measure the magnitude and nature of the interplanetary magnetic field (IMF) locally and to study the disturbed magnetic conditions and extreme solar events by detecting the CME from Sun as a transient event. The proposed secondary science objectives are to study the impact of interplanetary structures and shock solar wind interaction on geo-space environment and to detect low frequency plasma waves emanating from the solar corona at L1 point. This will provide a better understanding on how the Sun affects interplanetary space.
Since the quiet mode ambient Inter planetary Magnetic Field at L1 point is of the order of few nT and the magnetic field generated by the spacecraft field is of the order of few thousand nT, the 6 m boom will reduce the effect of spacecraft generated field by a factor of 200.
The Aditya-L1 FGM sensors are ring core based with ferromagnetic material as the core material provides the best noise performance and stability with temperature and time.
The primary goal of FGM aboard Aditya-L1 mission is 
    • to measure the magnitude and nature of IMF and its temporal evolution. It is also aimed at studying the disturbed magnetic conditions arising from extreme solar events such as Coronal Mass Ejection (CME)
    • to study of the consequences of IP shocks and IP counterparts of CMEs viz. magnetic clouds, etc., in the geospace environment. The IMF measurements are expected to provide important insights into the physical processes occurring in the Sun such as solar plasma wave generation and will also provide complementary measurements to that made by other plasma experiments onboard viz. ASPEX and PAPA.
      
One of the outstanding questions related to solar activity cycle presently is whether it is heading towards a minimum like Maunder Minimum in the past. This is based on the findings that the current solar cycle 24 is the weakest launched in the ascending phase of the solar cycle 25, it is expected to shed light on the behavior of the next activity cycle also.
       Apart from providing vital information on the long term variation of the solar activity cycle mentioned above, the Aditya-L1 FGM instrument will play a key role in identification of transient events occurring on the Sun viz. CMEs, in particular their IP counterparts. Attempts to relate the three part structure of CMEs viz. leading edge, cavity and prominence with their ICME counterparts like sheath, magnetic cloud and cold plasma are crucial to understand the propagation of CMEs in the IP medium and in forecasting the arrival time of CMEs a t the Earth. Combining data obtained from the plasma experiments on Aditya-L1 spacecraft e.g. PAPA and ASPEX, various signatures of the ICMEs can be traced to solar eruptions.
